Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all 
bars have the same width and the width is 1 unit, there will be N bars height of each bar will be given by the array arr.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {6,2,5,4,5,1,6}
Output: 12
Explanation: In this example the largest area would be 12 of height 4 and width 3. We can achieve this 
area by choosing 3rd, 4th and 5th bars.
